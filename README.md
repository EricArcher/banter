# banter

### Description

*banter* is a package for creating hierarchical acoustic event classifiers out of multiple call type detectors.

### Installation

To install the latest version from GitHub:

```r
# make sure you have devtools installed
if(!require('devtools')) install.packages('devtools')

# install package from GitHub
devtools::install_github('ericarcher/banter')
```

### For a complete tutorial, run `banterGuide()`.

### Quick Tutorial

The BANTER (Bio-Acoustic eveNT classifiER) model is initialized with a data.frame of events. There is one row per event and it must have a column called `event.id` which is a unique id for each event, and a column called `species` which assigns each event to a given species. Every other column in the data.frame will be used as a predictor variable for the events.  
In the package, an example data.frame is in the `train.data` example data list as the `$events` element.
```r
data(train.data)
bant.mdl <- initBanterModel(train.data$events)
```

Next, detector data is added to the initialized BANTER model object. Each detector is a data.frame with a column called `event.id` that associates the detected call with an event that the model was initialized with, and a `call.id` column that provides a unique identifier for each call. Every other column will be used as a predictor variable for the calls.  
In the package, example data.frames for three detectors are provided in the `$detectors` element of the `train.data` example data list. Here is an example of adding the burst pulse (`bp`) detector.

```r
bant.mdl <- addBanterDetector(
  bant.mdl, 
  data = train.data$detectors$bp, 
  name = "bp",
  ntree = 10, 
  sampsize = 1
)
```

The `addBanterDetector` function can be called repeatedly to add additional detectors. Alternatively, if the detectors are all in a named list, they can be added at once:

```r
bant.mdl <- addBanterDetector(
  bant.mdl, 
  data = train.data$detectors, 
  ntree = 10, 
  sampsize = 1
)
```

Once all of the detectors have been added, then the full BANTER model is run:
```r
bant.mdl <- runBanterModel(bant.mdl, ntree = 5000, sampsize = 3)
```

The model can be easily summarized:
```r
summary(bant.mdl)
```

The actual `randomForest` model can be extracted for the event or detector models:
```r
# extract event Random Forest model
event.rf <- getBanterModel(bant.mdl, "event")

# extract burst pulse (bp) Random Forest model
bp.rf <- getBanterModel(bant.mdl, "bp")
```

These can then be visualized using other tools, such as those in the `rfPermute` package:
```r
library(rfPermute)
plotVotes(event.rf)
```

To predict novel data, it must be in a list with the event data in the `$events` element, and the detector data in a named list called `$detectors`:
```r
data(test.data)
predict(bant.mdl, test.data)
```

### version 0.9.4 (devel)

* Detector names and detector predictor column names submitted to `addBanterDetector()` are now first checked to make sure they are syntactically valid and unique by comparing them with the results from `make.names()`.
* Detector names and detector predictor column names in `new.data` submitted to `predict()` are first checked to make sure at least one detector from model is present.
* Detectors missing in `new.data` for `predict()` will automatically have all species detector probabilities and detector proportions set to 0.
* Added validation option to `predict()` if `species` column exists in `new.data`
* Default value for num.cores has been set to 1.
* Added `banterGuide()`

### version 0.9.3 (on CRAN)

* Initial CRAN release
